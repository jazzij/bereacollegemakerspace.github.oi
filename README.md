# Overview
Academic makerspaces are like playgrounds for learning and developing creative skills. We provide the tools and materials, and you provide the ideas! Our makerspace at Berea currently focuses on computational projects-- ranging from digital art to robotics, to e-textiles. We encourage collaborative projects and peer mentoring-- come learn and share your skills!

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. Git
2. A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

"git clone https://github.com/bereacollegemakerspace/bereacollegemakerspace.github.io.git"

Assuming Visual Studio Code is opened:

1. Navigate to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
2. Search for "Live Server" and install it.
3. Open the HTML file you want to test.
