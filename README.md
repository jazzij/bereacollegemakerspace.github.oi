# Berea College Makerspace Homepage
This repo is the website for Berea College Makerspace. Contact @jazzij for more info.

Academic makerspaces are like playgrounds for learning and developing creative skills. We provide the tools and materials, and you provide the ideas! Our makerspace at Berea currently focuses on computational project-- ranging from digital art, to robotics, to e-textiles. We encourage collaborative projects and peer mentoring-- come learn and come share your skills!

This website is primarily for promotion and awareness of the space and what we offer. Active engagement and event announcements happen on our [Instagram!](https://www.instagram.com/bcmakerspace/)
